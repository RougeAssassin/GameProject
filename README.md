# GameProject
The game project is an exercise to improve on current programming skills while working towards a "fun" goal. Too often on breaks from school, such as summer vacation, coding skills get rusty through lack of use. This project aims to prevent that by focusing those skills on a problem that has not been attempted before and which provides a unique challenge. The game being designed will be simple to ensure an achievable goal. There will be no 3D engines used, as this will over complicate the project by introducing new software to lean and will distract from the premise of the project. The initial goal, which is subject to change, is to create a game that has a simple side-scroller mechanism, i.e. a character or object that can move within the bounds of the screen and can progress forward. After completion of the initial goal, a new goal will be determined to build upon the existing game. This might be adding a fighting or item mechanism.
